For Newcastle, the wait for silverware has been agonizing. The last time the Magpies lifted a major trophy, man had just set foot on the moon. That was back in 1969 when they won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
Since then, heartbreak has been a recurring theme, with painful cup final defeats in 1998, 1999, and most recently in 2023 when they fell short against Manchester United in this very competition.
The Sporting News looks at the key details ahead of this game, including how to watch the match, kickoff times and the latest lineup news.

Here's how to watch this Carabao Cup match in the U.S.:

This Carabao Cup clash takes place at the Wembley Stadium in Wembley, London and kicks off on Sunday, March 16 at 4:30 p.m. local time.

Here's how that time translates across the U.S.:
The worst fears of Liverpool fans became reality on Friday morning when Arne Slot confirmed that Trent Alexander-Arnold will miss the League Cup final after picking up an injury against PSG in the Champions League.

With Joe Gomez and Conor Bradley also sidelined due to hamstring issues, Slot suddenly finds himself without a single senior right-back for the trip to Wembley. Jarell Quansah is expected to step into the role, though the Dutchman threw in a curveball by mentioning Curtis Jones as a possible option in his press conference.

On the brighter side, Slot is optimistic that Ibrahima Konaté—who limped off midweek at Anfield—should be fit in time for Sunday. If not, he may have no choice but to slot Wataru Endo alongside Virgil van Dijk in the heart of the defense.

As for Tyler Morton, the young midfielder remains out with a shoulder injury, though his absence won’t shake up Liverpool’s starting lineup.
If Murphy, Isak, and Barnes can tap into their inner Dembele, Barcola, and Kvaratskhelia, Liverpool’s patched-up defense—especially the battered right flank—could be in for another long night at Wembley.

That said, Newcastle hasn’t exactly been a defensive fortress in recent weeks, and with far less experience in high-stakes cup finals than their opponents, the big question is whether they can handle the pressure when it matters most.

A tight contest is still on the cards, especially with Howe’s men having the fresher legs, but Slot’s tactical nous gives Liverpool the edge. A hard-fought win and a trophy lift to mark his first silverware in English football could be on the horizon.
