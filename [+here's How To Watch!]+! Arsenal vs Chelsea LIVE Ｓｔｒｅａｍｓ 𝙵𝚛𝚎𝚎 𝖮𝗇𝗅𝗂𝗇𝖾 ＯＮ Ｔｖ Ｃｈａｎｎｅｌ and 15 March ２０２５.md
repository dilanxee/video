Mikel Arteta’s side have two League games before the Reds return to the competition, so need to ensure they are in position to pounce on any slip-ups, as unlikely as it may be.

Arsenal were able to rest and rotate as they sealed Champions League progress against PSV Eindhoven earlier this week, putting them in a good position for the visit of the Blues.

Fourth-placed Chelsea are chasing Champions League qualification but it remains difficult to suggest Enzo Maresca’s team have fully turned a corner just yet, given the quality of some of their opposition of late.

Thursday’s win over Copenhagen sealed their progress into the quarter-finals of the Conference League, with attention now turning back into their quest to qualify for Europe’s elite club competition. A win at the Emirates would be some statement of intent on that front.

Here’s everything you need to know about where to watch.
