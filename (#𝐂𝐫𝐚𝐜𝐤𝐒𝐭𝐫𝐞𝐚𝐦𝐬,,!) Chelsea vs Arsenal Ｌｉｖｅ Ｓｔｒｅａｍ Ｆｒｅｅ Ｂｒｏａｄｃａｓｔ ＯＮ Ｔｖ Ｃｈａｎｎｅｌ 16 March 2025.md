The Gunners' title ambitions took a major hit following last weekend's 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, leaving them with a mountain to climb in the race to catch Liverpool. Meanwhile, the battle for European spots remains intense, with Arsenal sitting four points ahead of third-placed Nottingham Forest, while Chelsea have clawed their way back into the top four after a recent dip in form.

Mikel Arteta's side has experienced mixed fortunes of late. A commanding 9-3 aggregate triumph over PSV Eindhoven secured their Champions League quarter-final berth, yet their league form has been patchy.

Chelsea, too, have endured a rollercoaster spell. A 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa exposed their defensive frailties, particularly against counter-attacks, but they responded in emphatic fashion with a dominant 4-0 rout of Southampton, capitalizing on wide play and set-piece efficiency. A hard-fought 1-0 victory over Leicester City further steadied the ship as they aim to consolidate their place in the top four.

Chelsea F.C. is chasing Arsenal F.C. at the top of the table, with a major opportunity to gain ground in the English Premier League on Sunday, March 16 (3/16/2025) at Emirates Stadium in London, England.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: English Premier League, Matchday 29

Who: Arsenal vs. Chelsea

When: Sunday, Mar. 16, 2025

Time: 9:30 a.m. ET

Where: Emirates Stadium, London, England

Thomas Tuchel praised Jordan Henderson as “a serial winner” in welcoming him and a resurgent Marcus Rashford back to the England team on Friday.

Tuchel included the pair in his first squad as England coach ahead of World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley Stadium.

Both Henderson and Rashford missed out on last summer’s European Championship under then-coach Gareth Southgate and faced uncertain international futures.

Arsenal team news

Mikel Arteta has been forced to navigate much of the season without his preferred attacking trio, but there's finally light at the end of the tunnel, with Bukayo Saka expected to return after the March international break.

Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, was named among the substitutes at Old Trafford and could be in contention for a starting role against Chelsea. The Brazilian also made a late cameo in Arsenal's midweek clash with PSV Eindhoven, featuring for the final 11 minutes as the Gunners sealed their Champions League quarter-final spot.

With Raheem Sterling unavailable due to loan restrictions, either Mikel Merino or Ethan Nwaneri is expected to lead the line.

Injury woes persist, though, with Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, and Takehiro Tomiyasu ruled out for the remainder of the campaign. However, Arsenal otherwise boast a near fully fit squad, having had the luxury of resting Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Thomas Partey, and Martin Odegaard in their comfortable aggregate win over PSV.

Chelsea team news

Chelsea are grappling with multiple injury setbacks ahead of their upcoming fixtures. Nicolas Jackson picked up a hamstring issue during the February 3 clash with West Ham and isn’t expected back until April.

Similarly, Marc Guiu remains sidelined with a muscle injury, with his return penciled in for after the international break. Noni Madueke also suffered a hamstring problem against Brighton on February 14 and is on a similar recovery timeline.

There is some positive news for the Blues, though, as Romeo Lavia has rejoined full training and could be in contention for selection in the coming weeks. Chelsea still have unfinished business in the Europa Conference League, with a crucial showdown against Copenhagen on Thursday night. There was a boost on the injury front, as Reece James and Cole Palmer were both spotted back in training on Tuesday, joined by Christopher Nkunku as he continues his recovery.

Arsenal and Chelsea meet in the Premier League later today. It is a huge clash at the Emirates Stadium, with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta insisting the title is not yet gone. Catching Liverpool looks a very remote possibility at best but Arsenal are in League action twice before the Reds return to the competition.

With that in mind, Arsenal have the chance to put at least some distant pressure on the league leaders, albeit it remains difficult to imagine a scenario in which Liverpool let it slip up from here. Still, Arteta was able to make sweeping changes against PSV in the Champions League earlier this week having wrapped it up in the first leg, so should be fresh for the visit of the Blues.

Enzo Maresca’s side are chasing Champions League qualification. They sit fourth heading into their trip to the Emirates and are on course to do so, although it remains difficult to judge them given their opponents of late.

Arsenal and Chelsea square off in a high-stakes clash between two Big Six rivals battling at the top of the table. Arsenal, sitting 15 points behind league leaders Liverpool after a 1-1 draw with Manchester United, have a golden opportunity to close the gap, as this fixture was brought forward to Matchday 29.

The Gunners will be eager to capitalize, while Chelsea aim to solidify their place in the Champions League spots. With Manchester City lurking, the Blues need a win to stay in the top four race and they will go after it.fgdsfdsa
